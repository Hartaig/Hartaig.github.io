I received my Bachelors in Applied Mathematics & Statistics with a minor in jazz music in May 2016 from Stony Brook University. I am currently pursuing a Masters in Biostatistics from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. My research interests and skills include patient data analytics, and machine learning & data mining applications to healthcare. I have extensive programming experience in R, SAS, SQL, and MATLAB.    

I'm a boundlessly curious and ambitious individual who loves the surprise of discovery through research and data. My hobbies include playing jazz guitar, basketball, DJ, and electronic music production. I am a habitual reader with particular interests in human behavior, social psychology, evolutionary psychology, moral psychology, religion & politics, and the brain.
