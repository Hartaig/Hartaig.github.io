I received my Bachelors in Applied Mathematics & Statistics with a minor jazz music in May 2016 from Stony Brook University. I am currently pursuing a Masters in Biostatistics from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. My research interests and skills include consumer behavior modeling, quantitative psychology, and machine learning & data mining applications to public health and policy. I have extensive programming experience in R, SAS, and MATLAB. Upon graduation in May 2018 I plan to pursue a PhD or enter the industry utilizing and enhanching my statistical methodology skills.   

I'm a curious and self-driven individual who loves the surprise of discovery through research and data. My hobbies include playing jazz guitar, basketball, DJ, and electronic music production. I am a habitual reader with particular interests in human behavior, social psychology, evolutionary based psychology, religious & political psychology and the brain.
